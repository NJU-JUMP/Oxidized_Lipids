# Oxidized_lipids_Martini2

0. insanex.py
Modified version of Martini insane.py to generate lipid bilayer systems containing oxidized lipid models based on Maritni v2.2 12-bead POPC and DOPC.

1. Example simulation setups for membrane systems with different peroxidized positions. 

2. Example simulation setups for membrane systems with different peroxidized levels.
